# Overview

This repository is filled with examples of how to create graphs in R. These are the first R programs that I have written so while they are simple, they can be useful for beginners to have more examples of the R programming language.

I have multiple graphs that can be created by highlighting everything in the current R file then pressing ctrl+ enter. This will allow you to see the various graphs with their unqique twists and uses. There are a couple of csv files that a couple of the programs pull from.

My purpose in writing these programs was to learn R and hopefully to help others to start to understand the unique nature of this language. It was also a fun way with visualiztions that I could look at and see how to make different visualizations using R code.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment


I used Visual studio code as an IDE, some csv files, and github desktop.

R is a programming language that is mainly used to interpret data. The data can be taken directly through the program or taken from a csv or other file. The libraries used are mostly just to ensure that we can plot things and display the graphs.

# Future Work

- Make all of the graphs able to use a csv file some can't yet.
- Make all of them combined into one so that the user can load one file and see it in many different ways.
